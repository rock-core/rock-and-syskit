# Tasks and Events
{:.no_toc}

{:toc}

In [the runtime overview](../runtime_overview/task_structure.html) as well as in
this section's [generalities](generalities.html), we have briefly brushed the
subject of **tasks and events**. This section will (finally) detail these two
concepts. The goal of this section is to provide you with tools you can use to create
tasks that generate events relevant for system coordination. We will in particular:

- explain the role of events and tasks within a Syskit system.
- detail primitives that allow tasks to synthetize events that will be
  relevant to coordinate the system, for instance by listening to data streams
  generated by components.
- show how to create "pure" tasks - by opposition to components -
  and how they are relevant to building more complex Syskit systems.
- also, how "active" tasks can be created, that actually implement
  functionality in the system, and where this is a good idea vs. implementing
  a full blown component. We will see how to implement "ruby components" in
  this section, such as the [ConstantGenerator](../basics/constant_generator.html)
  from the basics tutorial.

## Concepts

Profiles (for component networks) and actions (for other functionality)
are the high-level tools with which you present what the system can do.
In particular, the component network subsystem hides a lot of complexity,
letting you work with models of the component networks you want to run.

Unfortunately, actual runtime is more complicated than that. To handle runtime,
Syskit internally manages everything that it has under its control in a different
data structure, called a **plan**.

One dimension within this plan aims at organizing the _processes_ that are being
executed within the system. Each process is represented by a **task** object,
and task object(s) are linked together through the
[task structure](../runtime_overview/task_structure.html).
This provides syskit with a hierarchical view of the processes: how each process
is related to the other process(es), and in particular to the system's
[missions](generalities.html#missions).

The other dimension within this plan is temporal: the ability to track when "things"
happen, but also the ability to control the system by "ordering" it to make
something happen. This dimension is represented by _events_. Events are part of the
tasks (in a way, they are "managed" or "implemented" by the tasks).

On the one hand, events are _emitted_ to tell the system that the task
achieved something. All tasks have for instance a "start" event which is
emitted when the task has finished starting, or a "stop" event which is
emitted when it has finished stopping. Coordination models in Syskit are
essentially reacting to these emissions, an if-then subsystem that uses these
event emissions as "triggers". Defining and emitting new events is therefore
one of the most common tasks when coordinating behaviors.

On the other hand, **some** events can also be commanded. These events are
said to be controlable. For instance, the system can order most tasks to
start ("start" is controlable), but while a lot of tasks can be interrupted
("stop" is controlable), it cannot be made to succeed with almost certainty
("success" is thus not controlable, it is instead said to be contingent).

One important job of the task hierarchy is to provide meaning to a collection
of tasks. The plan should allow to reflect **why** things are being executed.
For instance, a robot's trajectory follower could be here for a simple
point-to-point transit, but also could be used to execute a surveying
pattern. Differenciating between the two feels unimportant for nominal
execution - things get executed and succeed and everything is fine. It gets
however important for error handling and monitoring. A good rule of thumb is
that one should be able to recognize the action(s) that are being executed
just by looking at the task structure. This will be the subject of a
[later section](creating_abstractions.html)

## Creating Tasks

Plain task models are created with `syskit gen task`. They are subclasses of
[`Roby::Task`](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/rock-core/tools-roby/Roby/Task),
are defined in the `App::Tasks` module and are saved within the `models/tasks` folder.

~~~ shell
syskit gen task task_name
~~~

The default template adds a [`terminates`]() statement. This indicates that the
task can be interrupted without further action, which is a common thing for
plain tasks. Conversely, for instance, the task class that manages Rock
components - [`Syskit::TaskContext`](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/rock-core/tools-syskit/Syskit/TaskContext) - will attempt to stop the component when
its stop command is called, and will wait for the component to be stopped
before its stop event is emitted. We cover how components are integrated at runtime
[later in this chapter](component_networks.html)

`Roby::Task` and all its subclasses have five events:
- `start` which is always controlable
- `stop`, `success` and `failed` which are contingent
- `internal_error` which is contingent

The emission of `success` and `failed` trigger the emission of `stop`.

Additional contingent events (events that can only be emitted) are defined with

~~~ ruby
event :event_name
~~~

Additional controlable events (events that can be commanded) are defined with

~~~ ruby
event :event_name do |*|
    # Code that will eventually emit the event
    # Emit the event with ${event_name}_event.emit
end
~~~

The events themselves are instances of [`Roby::EventGenerator`](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/rock-core/tools-roby/Roby/EventGenerator). They can be
accessed with `${event_name}_event` accessors. For instance, one emits the
stop event with `stop_event.emit`, checks whether it has ever been emitted
with

Note that an event command does not have to emit the event. It is expected to
ensure that the event will be emitted _eventually_. `Syskit::TaskContext` for
instance calls the component's `start` operation but will emit the event only
when the component state change has reached the Syskit process.

Because Syskit's runtime is essentially
[an event loop](../runtime_overview/event_loop.html), the commmand **must not**
block. Commanding an asynchronous external process is an advanced subject,
[covered by this page in the cookbook](../cookbook/async.html).

## Task-level Code

One objective of this chapter is to teach you

Right now we have seen how to define a task, and how to populate it with events
(beyond the default ones), let's see the different ways we can implement tasks
that listen to certain conditions to emit its events.

### The poll block

Calling `poll` with a block, within a task's class definition, defines a
block that will be executed at each execution cycle (usually 100ms). The
block is evaluated in the context of the task instance (i.e. `self` is the
task instance). There can be only one poll block at each level of the class
hierarchy, and you must call `super()` to call the implementation from the
superclass.

For instance, a task that would emit stop after a configurable amount of time
could be written:

~~~ ruby
class TimeoutTask < Roby::Task
  terminates

  argument :timeout

  event :start do
    # NOTE: Roby::Task#lifetime already gives the amount of
    # time executed. This is done this way for illustrative reasons
    @deadline = Time.now + timeout
    start_event.emit
  end

  poll do
    super()

    stop_event.emit if Time.now > @deadline
  end
end
~~~

### Data readers

When within Syskit, one common use-case for events is to listen for a given
condition in one of the component's data streams. This is usually done at a
composition level, in order to keep the component itself as generic as
possible.

Accessors that will allow the task to read an output port can be created
with the `data_reader` declarator at the class level. The argument is a port,
which - when in a composition - can be a child's port. When the child is a
data service, the actual port will be resolved transparently. For instance:

~~~ ruby
data_reader position_child.position_samples_port, as: 'system_pose'
data_reader status_port, as: 'filter_status'
~~~

Within the task, in e.g. the poll block we have just seen, a reader can
be accessed with the `_reader` suffix appended to the reader name, e.g.:

~~~ ruby
if (sample = system_pose_reader.read_new)
elsif (sample = filter_status_reader.read)
end
~~~

### Data writers

Sometimes, passing arguments to lower level tasks through the
[`from(:parent_task)` mechanism](../component_networks/composition.html#argument_from_parent_task) is simply not enough. A common occurence is to
have to convert a task argument into data sample(s) that are written to one of
the component's ports. This is done using data writers.

Port writers are created in a way that's very close to the data readers, but
using the `data_writer` declaration:

~~~ ruby
data_writer controller_child.cmd_port, as: 'command'

poll do
  super()

  cmd = generate_command
  command_writer.write(cmd)
end
~~~

One has to be **extremely** careful when writing "only once" to ports. It is
obviously necessary to make sure that the remote end is ready to read the sample,
which requires to:

- make sure the task is running
- make sure the data writers is ready to send

Both tests are provided with the `#ready?` method. When writing periodically,
this can be safely ignored. When writing only once, make sure the writer is
ready before you write.

~~~ ruby
data_writer planning_child.problem_port, as: 'problem'
data_reader planning_child.plan_port, as: 'plan'

poll do
  super()

  if problem_writer.ready? && !@problem_written
    problem_writer.write(problem)
    @problem_written = true
  end

  if (plan = plan_reader.read_new)
    # Do something with the plan
    success_event.emit
  end
end
~~~

## Creating Functionality with Syskit Tasks

In addition to writing code in either pure ruby tasks or in compositions and
task contexts, Syskit allows you to create full functionality using Syskit
tasks. One can for instance do simple calculations, or dynamically create
simple components such as the
[`ConstantGenerator`](../basics/constant_generator.html), which would be
rather tedious in C++.

Generally speaking, restrict yourself to simple functionality. Anything more
complex than the constant generator should really be implemented as a
standalone component
{: .warning}

These tasks are subclasses of
[`Syskit::RubyTaskContext`](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/rock-core/tools-syskit/Syskit/RubyTaskContext).
They are created with `syskit gen ruby-task` and live within the
`Syskit::Compositions` namespace and `models/compositions/` folder:

~~~ ruby
syskit gen ruby-task my_task
# Created MyApp::Compositions::MyTask in models/compositions/my_task.rb
~~~

Within the ruby task context definition, input and output ports can be created:

~~~ ruby
import_types_from "base"

class MyTask < Syskit::RubyTaskContext
  input_port "in", "/base/Time"
  output_port "out", "/base/Time"
end
~~~

A ruby task thus created can be used the same way than any normal component.
However, accessing the ports is different:

- when accessing a port of a remote component, you access the ports from the outside.
  This is why one uses a data writer to connect to an input (and writes to the input),
  and a data reader to connect to an output (and read from it)
- when accessing a port of a ruby task, the ports are accessed from the inside.
  One therefore does not need a separate reader/writer (we have direct access
  to the ports themselves), and would write to an output and read from an input:

Within a `Syskit::RubyTaskContext`, the component's ports are accessed through the
task's `#orocos_task` property. They support the common port API (`#connected?`,
`#read` and `#read_new` for input ports, `#connected?`, `#write` for output ports).
For instance:

~~~ ruby
import_types_from "base"

class MyTask < Syskit::RubyTaskContext
  input_port "in", "/base/Time"
  output_port "out", "/base/Time"

  poll do
    super()

    while (in_time = orocos_task.in.read_new)
      orocos_task.out.write(in_time + 1)
    end
  end
end
~~~
